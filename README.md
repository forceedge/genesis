Quickly build RAD/Agile web applications with Genesis.

Installation

clone this repo to use instantly

`
git clone git@bitbucket.org:wqureshi/genesis.git`

Start off by configuring your web server locally, i recommend using the php internal web server from the Public folder

`
$ cd Genesis/Public
$ php -S localhost:8010
`

This should start the web server. Go to localhost:8010 in your web browser to look at your cloned project.

The intended database server to be used with Genesis is SQLite, as its a zero configuration database, you dont need to worry about anything else other than starting the PHP server which we have done above.

Thats it, your ready to roll! ;)
